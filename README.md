# 🧠 Deep Learning Challenge — CNN + LSTM from Scratch

This project is part of a deep learning challenge designed to test **fundamental understanding and coding skills** — no shortcuts allowed! 🚀

---

## 📋 Challenge Description

You must build a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** combined with a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** network entirely **from scratch**, using only **low-level libraries like NumPy**.

Your task is to implement both architectures manually — from **convolution operations** and **backpropagation** to **sequence modeling** — without relying on high-level frameworks such as:
- PyTorch 🧩  
- TensorFlow 🔥  
- scikit-learn ⚙️  
- transformers 🤖  

If implementing both models feels too ambitious, you may submit only a **CNN** or only an **LSTM** model.  
However, **full CNN+LSTM implementations** will earn **double points** 🏆 for demonstrating mastery of deep learning architecture integration.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### 🔹 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Manual implementation of convolution and pooling layers  
- Activation functions (ReLU, Softmax, etc.) implemented with NumPy  
- Backpropagation through convolutional filters  

### 🔹 Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Gate computations (input, forget, output) coded manually  
- Sequence processing with hidden and cell states  
- Integration with CNN outputs for sequential modeling
